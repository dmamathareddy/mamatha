    <p><b>Launched in 2010, Zomato is a technology platform that connects customers,
         restaurant partners, and delivery partners, serving their multiple needs.
          Customers use Zomato to search and discover restaurants, read and write 
          customer-generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery,
           book a table, and make payments while dining out at restaurants. 
        On the other hand, Zomato provides restaurant partners with industry-specific
         marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their
          business while also providing a reliable and efficient last-mile delivery service. 
          Zomato also operates a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies
           high-quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners. 
           Zomato also provides its delivery partners with transparent and flexible 
           earning opportunities...</b></p>
